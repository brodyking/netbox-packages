  you can only use netbox 0.6 BTW! 0.5 will not work!<br>
  <code>install https://netmanager.pyronode.repl.co/install.js</code><br>
  <br>
  <br>
  you can check your netbox version by typing <code>'version'</code> in the console.<br>
  <br>
  versions of netbox that are older that v0.5 are not fully supported.
  you can try to use it but i reccomend upgrading if you want to use this.
